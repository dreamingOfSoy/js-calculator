# js-calculator

A simple calculator made using JavaScript.

I'd learned the basics of JavaScript through other means, however, in checking out The Odin Project online (and subsequently skipping through the foundation part of the course), I saw that the final project to round off the Js basics section was to build a calculator. I thought (after stepping away from coding for a few months to finish university) this would be a good step back in, so I took it upon myself to build this calculator using everything I'd already learned myself - and with the odd check on MDN Web Docs.

I mapped out the logic on my own, and coded this from scratch. I was very happy when I realised I'd retained a lot of previous knowledge and was able to apply it here.

I took the time to refactor my code, making it as DRY as possible, this practicing good coding habits. One thing I did learn, however, is that refactoring less code, more often, is much better than more code, less often.

Overall, I'm please with this calculator. You can fiddle with him [HERE](https://calcpal.netlify.app).
